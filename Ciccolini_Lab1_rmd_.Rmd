```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Front Material 

Some intro stuff to say. Blah, blah, blah...


## Section Header {.tabset}

Section headers are awesome and useful. Use them, please!!

If you so desire you can also use tabs. To create tabs add `{.tabset}` to the section header under which you would like to include tabs. This will automatically place the material under the next level of header (`###`) in a new tab. Cool beans.

### This is my new tab

Say some stuff here. 

Then create a code chunk.

```{r my_first_chunk}

summary(cars) #write some code, get some results, do a little dance

```


### This is my second tab

OOOOH, another tab.


#### This will create a sub-header in a tab

Not sure why you would need to but you can technically do this.

If you find you want more space between lines of text or between code chunks and text insert the text `</br>` which is `html` for line-break.

</br> 


## Back to our primary section headers

Now let's make  a standard subsection (without tabs).


### Adding images

I can add an image like this.

`<center>![](fixing_problems.png)</center>`

<center>![](fixing_problems.png)</center>

</br>

`<center>` is a brute-force way of telling Markdown to start centering some text or an image, `</center>` tells Markdown to stop centering. (This should be familiar to anyone who poked around with html code.) 

### Adding url links

I can add a link to a url like this: [mycoolwebsite](https://www.ruralityindex.com). Just put the text that will be linked in square brackets and immediately follow it with the url in parentheses.

### Code chunk options

I can also change code chunk settings to make my documents purtier (or at least less messy). There are lots of options. Here are a few.

```{r my_custom_chunk, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=4, fig.height=4}

plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)

```
